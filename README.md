# Scramble
  Scramble is a social networking website dedicated to Product Reviews. Users can create accounts to post their feedback for existing products such as backpacks, televisions, and sunglasses. It's goal is to provide an efficient way to share your opinions on tangible products being sold on the market, which can later be referenced by real users who are looking to purchase that product. 
  The interface is designed to be easy to understand and access, drawing inspiration from websites such as Medium. User created reviews will be randomly posted on the front page for guests to browse through.
